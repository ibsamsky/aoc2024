# Day 3

regex is probably the most straightforward way to do this, but i'm still learning winnow so i decided to use that instead.

my biggest issue with the current implementation is that i produce a lot of `None` tokens that i have to filter out later. improving the parser logic could probably fix this, but it might be less ergonomic.
